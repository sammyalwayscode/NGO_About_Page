        <p>This is where Grassroot Soccer comes in. Our programs leverage the universal appeal of soccer as the platform to reach adolescents during this critical time. Using soccer as the hook, we engage adolescents in making healthy decisions through our Three Câ€™s: an adolescent-friendly and evidence-based health Curriculum, the supportive influence of local mentor and role model Coaches, and a fun, inclusive, and positive Culture.</p></div>
